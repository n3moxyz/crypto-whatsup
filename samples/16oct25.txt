Liquid Market Update (16-Oct'25) #macro
3 day consolidation approx. Upcoming is the all-member meeting (17/we may)

1) CN flash crash events:
• This is probably spot was President Trump's bullion threat to impose 100% tariffs on Chinese imports, in response to China's threats to restrict rare earth metal exports critical for US tech
• News broke at that institutional markets closed) Asia was asleep and US saw off their decks — setting off a sharp wave of deleveraging in crypto markets.
• Multiple drop on at once: from leveraged and liq holders, a Chain of Forced selling + unchained car sells crashed in lower lowers, echoing showers, triggering further liquidation. Classic reflexively loop.

Scale of ~2300 period, >$200 in leveraged crypto positions were liquidated – the largest single day liquidation event in crypto history.
• Altcoins that didn't protect users may be higher than this includes: "0.0M" figure, because exchanges like Binance reject only a limited number of liquidation orders per second (hard/s) underreporting)
• NOTE: BTC hit ~$74–76k Headlines: MaxZ $74.6k / BN: $77.7k OKX: $74.5k (so during a day – like a six sigma – like a 0.6% move day)
• BTC dumped ~15%: ETH dumped ~20%: SOL dumped ~28%: alts dumped 40–45%
• ~5.6M traders got liquidated, including 4K whales (>$1M accounts)
• OI fell - ~$22B in open interest withdrew from BTC, ~4.5B from ETH = ~$35B washout overall, a complete liquidation flushing of market
• Only major stakeholder + whales and MMs, longer-term believers. Others: Derisking means fewer active ADA staked (vs in the DDK-29Y range, hand some MAI as well but can't verify...

Scenes that simplified the panic:
• Two major events occurred: Friday night US / Saturday Asia — CVXE classic: Tariff equity down, and algos dominated flow. The recent hi ratios led or aids is painful to dampen liquidation loops.
• Exchange btc discount: whiptail waxed down e.g. ~$95k CME (because people unable to sell) VS $53k traded in the $80/90s while ETH was much higher), leading to faulty oracles and unfair liquidations.
• Funding was >100% annualized before the cascade, suggesting markets were in a crowded long. Now the funding rates are very much short biased.
• Funds scrambling to protect their once margin positions through MMIs or presenting debt craft assets — meanwhile in a flash cat of margin in, when the prices kicked and had mkst ahead phase1 where chips had run out

2) NOW
• There is an extreme deleveraging event that exposed how fragile the leveraged structure of this crypto market is under stress:
  - A lot of now for DXs to reflect on (esp)ally the largest responsible players.
• Me on the current status: $86k BTC (MACD bearline breached), volatility smoothed (vols than OCs), suggesting that DeRl isn't buy incat resilience and Fested fation. although –much smaller scale in 5 btvms,
  - Manual LS strategies don't seek side, most attempts at the EV on this Lees assets are dominated affected. Many hang strong assets and deal ease allocation. Problem solid that is the Short leg will have Cb will (less much ratter than fing bpl with larger Gi leading to AGi's = recommended way, but will make some elsewhere like this.
  - Still recommended that we hedge our positions in dex perps (this way we get out of centralized liquidation risk).
• Retail greed was so amped splits will take a while to return. Plus we quantify he institutions will also take a while as they remain defensive to "see what's next"
• BTC in short term will remain into wide band, LL to next event likely is as part week before rally, signaling a Highly volatile period ahead.
• The event did blow intends OTC/OE swollen on exchange exit contracts, reapplies ADA, mechanics-free unchanged expect entrantportcy.
• This is 10x worse than an earnings crash, coupled on a continuous market -- hasn't a capital on-time on eve of Q2' CPI — DAS is 1D from Q1!

[HOW THIS EVENT RESHAPES Q4 FOR CRYPTO MARKETS]

1) Leverage reset + cleaner base:
• The market is far largely de-levered. OI collapsed by 30–40% across majors, funding neutralized, and perp premiums reset. HL OI dropped to 50%. Ethena redemptions >$2.5B.
• The subsequent rally in Q4 likely to be spot-led and more sustainable -- though slower momentum

2) Volatility shock alerts front-runners premiums:
• Retail enthusiasm is crushed, social metrics and retail inflows will lag for weeks, X % TG sentiment and frequency of posts already significantly lower.
• Expect reduced participation from retail, e.g. Korean high-leverage traders, streamers, until confidence builds.

3) Institutional defensiveness, will not change:
• Institutions will stay defensively bid.
• Potentially more passive ETF outflows, expecting BTC / ETH ETF flows on MSTR / BRRR DAT prices to jump as leading indicators for a potential reversal.
• Bids should first come in on majors and high market-cap assets vs. riskier alt bets on even-newer TGEs.

4) "Trump tariff shock" = volatility, regime shift
• Correlation btw crypto-macro will persist. Expect a risk-off bias through Q4 due to market hating any element of uncertainty.
• Fed's dovish bias (post September FOMC) and potential rate cuts in Q4 / early-26 still provide a supportive floor for risk assets.

BOTTOM LINE:
• The result is that Q4 starts from a far healthier baseline – less leverage, higher vol, and scarred sentiment.
• That combination historically sets up accumulation periods rather than continued pain (retail has no more left to sell, but the next leg higher on better grounds. Dens macro flow cycles.
