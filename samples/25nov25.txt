Liquid update (25 Nov) #macro

Apologies all - been in military so haven't been able to prepare the regular liquid updates.

A quick few points:
• Volumes across the board are at an ATL: CEXs, ETFs (IBIT had their largest volume drop this month since its inception)
• DAT/ are down 50–80% from their prices pre-10/10 crash (this entire trade is likely done except for the hope of some diligent management that might be able to change them into operating companies cc. this post)
• Alts are down horrendous and there's been little to no marginal buyers - all while private investors are still up decent so unlocks create infinite sell pressure while demand is absent. This reinforces the need for liquid capital designated specifically for support for alts on secondary market (post-tge or heavily discounted projects that are still building great products)

Light at the end of the tunnel:
• Fed has been teasing that prices may potentially go down and the job market is deteriorating. These two areas of focus by the Fed increases the likelihood of rate cuts by EOY and going into next year.
• The market needs an external catalyst to lift sentiment, so this is smth to watch out for.
• There's a lot more instis and funds in stables than there are exposed folks at this point, so I think very few coins left to sell -- and we're closer to the bottom than not.
• Price wise: we want to see that 81k low hold even if we chop from here, and if it does for Dec even with funds doing tax harvesting, we should be good for a Christmas rally into Q1 (barring any trump / macro uncertainties)
