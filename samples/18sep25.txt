Fed cuts rate by 25bps!
• The nonfarm say rises to jobs have risen, but inflation has "moved up" and remains "somewhat elevated."
• Therefore: "shallow easing pace."
• Dot plot: A 0.50% cut in 2025, 27% view.
• Likely 25bps every month until EOY, but strictly data-dependent.
• Slow measured path of reducing rates while accounting for higher prices
• "Tone: easing, but not easing "at all costs."
• Heavily appraised crypto friendly fed member (Stephen Miran) was the only one! who opted to lower the target range by 50bps, he's politically loud, but the majority chose 25 bps — he's a bro.
• Data: Compared to June, Fed participants still see inflation >2% through 2026 and a funds rate settling near ~3% longer run.
• Interpretation: policy stays restrictive-ish in real terms for longer if inflation behaves as projected.

Don't time from the basis level:
• Bias: modestly bullish / relief bid / then chop, as biggest macro uncertainty of the year is out of the way. Outcome matters, but ridding off market uncertainty is the most important.
• Gut feel: September has historically been weak for risk assets, and right now we're heading into another historically weak month, October.
• But: no promise of rapid cuts, QT continues, and the statement says inflation "has moved up." Listening to his speech live on and Powell is being way too politically correct by giving room for change if data (SEP - Summary of Economic Projections) turns out bad... lame.
• Expect chop after the rise impulse in yields (same day GDP gm that resulted in them only that is saw towards (nothing "buy the news."
• If Oct/Nov data goes our way (disinflation gets), we might get an all, if it doesn't (increasing inflation), we likely see a rate cut pause and down only.

Net-net this is modestly positive for crypto now; conditionally positive over the next 1–2 months -- only if Inflation cooperates.
