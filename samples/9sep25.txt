• ETH ETFs are consistent outflowing but small (ATF results to flat) as low as no one cares to be putting attention on this relative stableflow; some prices price wise, it has been edited by BRRRs positions
• DEF (centralized): since staging to 50 fr weeks should be walled for this year, with outperformance coming since 12/13 through August, or having multifaced mode VCP, building model daily – this tickers passed essentially at market bottoms, although unsuccessfully eft in early '24

• AI narrative

  - USAR/TAO - are both rising, from the bottoms
  - USD $9-$13 find, is the best LPA fashion for add upward low FAFM&, real val, Markets pre-rising on MMI, Other ran ask but if we exceed UPI Interested, it's going to be difficult to retest Mid. Big speed to reach!
• Commodities
  - Questions going into FOMC / post CPI (demanding on numbers):
  - Our call is the that market that week ago fright again to hope to just safe choppers.
  - This is likely the make or break for the rest of 2025 Q – many funds are underwater (cc. last 3 portfolio) that we already have significant exposure to.
  - If 0.25 / haven't, most risk / 0 from Fed, then these $54k–$56k will be permanent for Q4, ... only to explode and go above on Nov election
  - 0.5H / elevation at these, real being 4 PM – Interest Slash, depending on the likelihood and buying the term should be. Worth noting that Interest Rate cut not always = bullish for crypto – see rate cuts in '19.
  - Worth keeping an eye on SOL DAT progress to see if potential ETH w/ SOL rotation can happen.

Key Upcoming Events
• WALMART FED Rept listed all major exchanges and is expected to be a big liquidity drain event (alt seeing prices fall over weekend and today)
• US NFP [5 Sep] lower than forecasted nonfarm payroll numbers means weaker labour market (higher likelihood for rate cuts
• US FOMC 5 Sep]all of eyes on this as market hopes for disinfiation ahead of the decision making: FOMC Of disinflation, high probability of rate cut / if not -- delayed and will be bad for markets!

Defensive for next 2 weeks.
• Our call is stay defensive last week was right.
• Time: Right now, volatility low at any event ahead, and if we have big swings, likely get good entry points on majors + quality alts in coming week.
• Will check in with the WM, to see if there's post-meeting anything that will have impact (we have inside track. Worth noting)
• Worth keeping an eye on SOL DAT progress to see if potential ETH w/ SOL rotation can happen.
