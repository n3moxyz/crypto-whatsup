Liquid Market / Macro Update (1 Sep)

#macro

Macro:
• BTC down -6% to $57k after a flash crash below $51.5k triggered by the ETH/BTC sellion selling - ~480 of BTC to buy spot ETH on HL.
• ETH was last week's biggest loser, now $6.4k down ~11% from ATH of $4.75k -- as expected with slowing ETF and DAT flows.
• SOL: market strongly to seek a new high at/near July lows of $127M across all exchange ONIs, making it best jump long setup / came due, but the move has been entirely retracted at $200

Prices Recap
• BTC ETFs closed the week slightly positive at ~$60M net inflows, but it was nothing compared to the whole selling.
• ETH ETFs closed the week positive again with +$1B net inflows, meaning previous week's not outflow.

Thoughts
• No major movements from BTC or ETH DATs
• 2 new huge SOL DATs were announced + started fundraising calls
  - Galaxy Jump and Multicoin funding commits for $1B SOL DAT raise
  - Platinum fund raising calls for their $1.25B for DAT with Janko
  - Janiko announced their >$400M SOL DAT, not familiar with structure or progress (link)

Notable
• OTC: opens pathway for Americans to trade on offshore crypto exchanges such as Binance, OKX, CoinMarket etc. -- this is pretty bullish LT for CEX tickers (BNB, MNT, OKB, etc.)
  - Ethpass locks hedge fund Named at $500M; turniky crypto at Comporary firms c - NAV3 down 3x4 on the news, good move
• Trump media firm enters 49.4b its invest in CryptoMiami's digital token (DJO token 2.5+/l on the news, but there are better CEX token trade setups out there
  - FTX Distribution: A reminder that the $16B FTX creditor payments begin on the 30th. Potentially supply heavy for Sept.

Key Upcoming Events
• WALMART FED Rept listed all major exchanges and is expected to be a big liquidity drain event (alt seeing prices fall over weekend and today)
• US NFP [5 Sep] lower than forecasted nonfarm payroll numbers means weaker labour market (higher likelihood for rate cuts
• US FOMC [5 Sep] all of eyes on this as market hopes for disinfiation ahead of the decision making: FOMC Of disinflation, high probability of rate cut / if not -- delayed and will be bad for markets!

Defensive for next 2 weeks.
• Our call is to stay defensive this week again to hope to just safe choppers
