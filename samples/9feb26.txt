*Markets update (9 Feb 2026)* #liquid #macro

[See 5 Feb note for reference]

*1) Where we left off*
- The Feb 5 update confirmed bear market conditions after FOMC hawkishness and US-Iran geopolitical escalation.
- BTC had broken below $75k support targeting $69k, ETH was heading to $1.8k, and SOL eyeing $78.
- Stance was defensive - largely stabled up to preserve capital in a genuine downtrend.

*2) Current state of the market*
- BTC @ $69k after hitting the exact target level predicted in the last update - this is pre-Trump Oct '24 support being tested.
- ETH @ $2k continuing its relentless slide, now firmly below pre-BMNR territory.
- SOL @ $85 showing marginal outperformance versus ETH but still declining steadily with FTX unlock pressure ongoing + Multicoin figurehead leaving crypto.

*The technical damage is severe:*
- ETHBTC has completely collapsed through all prior cycle support levels and is approaching the 0.025 zone from pre-BMNR era.
- All three majors posting consistent daily losses with no attempt at dip buying from participants.
- But BTC holding the $69k level so far without a complete breakdown could signal some support (as long as no new lows below $60k for now..)

*3) Macro background*
- Jan CPI data due 12 Feb will be critical for Fed policy expectations after their hawkish stance -> higher than expected inflation would reinforce the Fed's restrictive bias and pressure crypto further.
- 14 Feb PPI data could also provide additional confirmation on inflation persistence.
- Geopolitical tensions with Iran remain stagnant with no signs of de-escalation.

*Additional input kindly from @Joseph_SEL !*

1. *U.S. Market: Labor Softening Ignites Rally* - The U.S. market successfully shifted to a "Risk-On" mode as cooling labor data—highlighted by Non-Farm Payrolls falling to 112k (vs. 150k expected) and the unemployment rate rising to 4.3%—fueled Fed rate cut expectations. This shift neutralized the uncertainty surrounding Kevin Warsh's nomination, driving the Dow Jones to a new All-Time High and sparking a major tech rally. While the rebound is strong, the market remains cautious about the long-term sustainability of this trend.

2. *Japan: Political Stability Drives Market Surge* - Japan's equity markets surged following the LDP's landslide victory, securing a two-thirds supermajority in the lower house. While the Yen initially weakened on expectations of continued Abenomics-style easing, it stabilized quickly as political uncertainty evaporated. Moving forward, the market is expected to remain somewhat mixed as investors await specific fiscal policy updates from the new cabinet.

3. *Crypto: Bitcoin Rebounds to Critical Technical Junction* - Bitcoin staged a dramatic recovery from the $60,000 level to reclaim the $70,000 range, bolstered by the broader tech rally and a technical rebound from an oversold RSI (below 20). BTC is hovering around the $70,300–$70,400 inflection point at the time of writing, a historical resistance zone from 2021 and 2024. If it clears this hurdle, the next key resistance lies in the $74,000–$77,000 range, which served as a major floor earlier in 2025.

*4) Outlook and conclusion*
- Bear market looks to be confirmed with this lack of bids: sustained downtrend with no signs of V-reversal.
- BTC holding critical $69k support is the key level to watch; a break below opens the door to much lower levels.
- Most mean-reversion traders that bought the huge capitulation on Friday have sold the 12~20% move on BTC, ETH, SOL - explains the current stall in prices.
- *Back to continuing preserving capital in stables.*
