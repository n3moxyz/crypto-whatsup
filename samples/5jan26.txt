Markets update (5 Jan 2026) #liquid #macro #MM!

Just back from the runway.

1) Revisiting last post
• Most of what I said in Dec '25: "the bounce looked structurally constructive, but not yet a confirmed regime flip"
• BTC was very strong, pushing past $95k but too many prior rallies since 10/10 had been sold into
• The prudent stance was to wait, not chase, and prepare a framework for when the market genuinely proves up

2) Price structure since Dec (just 1 mth)
Several of these constructive signals have now held:
• BTC: After chopping through $95k, BTC has rallied from the $87–88k base and now pushing past $99k again. This is the cleanest higher low we've seen since the Oct distribution phase post 10/10 tops
• ETH: Chopped back to hold ~$3k and is now battling out nearing/performing BTC – important if we want the move to extend beyond pure BTC strength.
• The market did not roll back over into new lows, which would have been the failure case for prior bounces.

3) Market - Are we SO back? Or just another Bounce?
Neither.
• BTC no longer trading at believer range i.e. close to the $84k level; price is spending larger amount of time at a higher level, which matters.
• Continuation of upside: This rally has persisted for more than a single impulse leg, unlike many failed moves since Oct
• Risk appetite improving: Equities and crypto have moved higher together recently, suggesting broader risk tolerance / improving liquidity
• Geopolitical desc-escalation: Recent headlines did not trigger a sharp crypto sell-off. The market's ability to not dump on Venezuela war news is an important signal.
• Stablecoin:
  - Still under broader consolidation: We are higher in the range, but not yet in bullish sentiment (see BTC chart).
  - Macro not outright supportive: There is no confirmed rate cut cycle, nor a fresh global liquidity impulse
  - QT's deflationary pressures: Several large sellers last month (solar resistance and oil energy sell into, so the market has conditioned participants to sell strength - preventing further rallies.

4) Macro Backdrop
• Fed expectations: Markets are still waiting for clearer confirmation on the timing and pace of rate cuts. Until then, rallies can progress, but tend to be more fragile.
• Geopolitics: Crypto surprisingly did not sell off on the US assault on Venezuela. When markets don't dump on sudden bad news, it could mean very few participants are actually deployed in the market (i.e. have few assets to dump)

5) Watchlist
For the best 5 buckets: 11 majors, 2 OG names, 3 pre-risk outperformers, 4 new names, 32 names
• Of those, Majors (BTC vs. ETH still the cleanest expression) while regime uncertainty remains
• OTHERS, if BTC continues up
  - Even though hype have rallied since Dec book, ETH/BTC remained flat at 0.034 (indicating no relative strength)
• Outperformers:
  - Pre-risk outperformers: watching for sustained follow. If these names start outperforming majors on pullbacks, that's a strong confirmation signal of flipping sentiment (e.g. ENA, HYPE)

CONCLUSION:
• The market today looks meaningfully healthier than it did in early December. Sellers less aggressive, risk appetite cautiously returning.
• We are likely in a transition phase, not a clear trend reversal. I hold trend.
• Don't fight tape situation: structure is there to buying dips, but also shouldn't sell the bottom
• Get ready to lean in and fully deploy (cash → majors / alts) if this level holds up well. More soon in DMs.
