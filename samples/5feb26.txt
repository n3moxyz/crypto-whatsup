*Markets update (5 Feb 2026)* #liquid #macro

[See 27 Jan note for reference]

*1) Where we left off*
- The previous update confirmed bear market conditions after FOMC hawkishness and geopolitical escalation with US-Iran.
- BTC had broken below $75k support with charts pointing to $70k next, while ETH was targeting $1.8k and SOL eyeing $78.
- The stance was defensive - largely stabled up to preserve capital.

*2) Current state of the market*
- BTC @ $73k after breaking $83k support (previous lows) and just one-way down. Next level is $69k for BTC which is pre-Trump in Oct '24.
- ETH down to $2.1k as selling pressure continues with no meaningful bounce attempts. Next level is $1.8k then $1.5k which is pre-BMNR in May '25.
- SOL weakest performer at $91, absolutely no bids like ETH. They have additional sell pressure from monthly FTX unlocks. Next level is ~$78 during Dec '23 period after Vitalik's legendary bottom tweet.
- HYPE incredibly strong amidst this market, cementing itself a true major for the next cycle (now alr >half of SOL FDV).

*The deterioration is accelerating:*
- ETHBTC collapsed to 0.028, setting new cycle lows below the 0.032 floor in Q4. This is approaching pre-BMNR levels which was 0.02-0.025 (when we entered the giga ETHBTC long).
- All three majors posting significant daily losses with no signs of dip buying.
- Speed and magnitude of this breakdown (slow consistent sells across days) suggests aggressive spot unwinding rather than deleveraged liquidations (i.e. bear market defensive mentality).

*3) Macro background*
- FOMC meeting last week concluded with Fed holding rates steady, but commentary more hawkish than expected on inflation persistence.
- Jan jobs data due Fri 6 Feb could be negative catalyst for further weakness if it comes out strong (good employment numbers = reinforce Fed hawkishness = push rate cut expectations).
- No other major macro events this week, but geopolitical tensions remain elevated.

*4) Outlook and conclusion*
- This confirms the bear market thesis - we're in a genuine downtrend, not just chop.
- Back in defensive, wait-and-see mode. Not the time to catch falling knives by allocating into alts with little edge (let alone large unlocks).
- Next major support zones: BTC $69k, ETH $1.8k, SOL $78 - but we may also not get there if macro changes (reassess closely).
